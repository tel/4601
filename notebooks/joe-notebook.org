4601 Sr. Des. Notebook
* <2010-01-14 Thu 12:00> Discussing Project Update Report (I)
+ Duties are:
  + Joe :: Project Description, Tables
  + Ginger/Shuyen :: EDS & Prototype Discussion
  + Sanjay :: (lead editor) Project Plan, Executive Summary
* <2010-01-20 Wed 12:00> Discussion Project Update Report (II)
+ Duties are the same as previously:
  + Joe :: Project Description, Tables
  + Ginger/Shuyen :: EDS & Prototype Discussion
  + Sanjay :: (lead editor) Project Plan, Executive Summary
** Design Considerations
*** Spinning things
+ /We're definitely not going to spin the micrometer/
  - High moment of inertia
  - Impossible to power/connect without breaking chords
  - High potential for vibration data contamination
+ What about moving the eye    
  - Eye can be fixed in some sort of plastic/polymer
  - Total device becomes much simpler
*** Eye attachment
We may need to build a custom eye harness to insert it into the
device.
+ Tweezers form core component
+ Custom fabricated part to link harness to spinning motor (?)
+ Containment cylinder for cleaning purposes and, possibly, filling
  the fixative
* <2010-01-25 Mon 22:00> Crafting Project Update Report
Project moved to LaTeX typesetting and git/Github version control.
+ Pros
  + Can manage multiple files
  + Instant typesetting
  + Beautiful typesetting
  + References automatically managed
  + Tables and figures automatically managed
  + Consistent style
+ Cons
  - Difficult to install and use
    - Especially on windows
  - Steep learning curve for git/github

/But we're doing it anyway/

[[http://github.com/tel/4601/commits/master][Commit log]]

Very, very successful editing session between Sanjay and I. Highly
coordinated, very little conflict between merges.
* <2010-01-27 Wed 12:00> Discussing Societal Impact
** Noted Societal Concerns
*** Research (proximate impact)
help researchers who will be able to make changes 
- taxpayers money via NIH, savings from efficiency
*** Medical (future impacts)
research leads to treatments (intro)
*** Environment
manufacturing and disposal, materials

+ during operation, no environmental impact
+ method to deal with contamination by biological elements –
  disposable case that catches the eye and prevents it from being
  shredded into machine b.  during creation – raw materials impact,
  manufacturing processes impact (what processes are we using),
  transportation (pollution and trucks!)

*** Disposal
EWH vs. we recycle parts
*** Packaging
cardboard box, styrofoam padding, environmentally friendly, minimal
space?
*** Electrical 
There is a small electrical impact that people in Africa would care
about because they actually need to conserve energy.
** Duties
+ Ginger :: Lead editor
+ Joe/Sanjay/Shuyen :: Content producers, each person should share
     writing the bulk of the document by examining societal impact
     concerns.
* <2010-01-30 Sat 15:00> Playing with the Micrometer
 + Micrometer can detach from power source for mounting. Probably not
   necessary.
 + Strong distortion of LED beam through test-tube + water. Need to
   correct with lens.
   + We'll need a rectangular case for preventing LED beam distortion
 + Dimensions available [[http://www.keyence.com/products/vision/micrometer/ls7000/ls7000_dimensions_1.php][@]]
** Micrometer output -> Binary Coded Decimal
   + 40 pins total, 30 for BCD and 10 for signals/escape/coding/timing
     + (4 pins x 7 digit) + (2 pins for polarity) = 30 pins
     + Strobe pin fires at 24,000/sec as update stream
   + Hirose HIF3B Ribbon Cable (HIF3-40CV) ([[http://www.hirose-connectors.com/connectors/H204ProductList.aspx?c1=HIF3B&c3=3][website]])
** NI Single-board RIO
   + Selection [[http://sine.ni.com/tabcat/app/main/p/ap/imc/lang/en][available]]
   + We only need digital IO
     + Analog IO is super expensive!
   + Best choice likely [[http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/205892][NI sbRIO-9602/9602XT]]
   + Sanjay will have to talk with boss and Essy to figure out what
     the best choice is.
** Actuators & Frame
+ We have screw-matrix board and aluminum column to host platform
+ We have microscope stand w/ motor+rotary encoder to get vertical motion
+ We have (small?) motor+rotary encoder for spinning
* <2010-02-01 Mon 16:30> Meeting with TA + SIA Meetup
+ Turns out we have a new TA: Matthew Magnuson <magnuson1@gmail.com>
+ SIA Report will be manned edited by Ginger
+ Each person responsible for covering 2x societal concerns
* <2010-02-02 Tue 13:00> Meeting with Nickerson
+ Optical quality cuvets -> available through Nickerson (~$100-500)
+ LED beam corrective lens -> Edmund Scientific (?)
** Eye biomechanics
+ Largely qualitative -> nobody has studied this sort of thing
  + /PAPER/: Mechanical properties of a spinning eyeball
+ Optic nerve is largely stiff excepting at the interface with the eye
  + Operates like a ball-socket joint to allow for motion of eye
  + /DRAW THIS/
*** Concerns
We'll have to model the stiffness of the optic nerve, the ball and
socket attachment model, the weight and moment of inertia of the eye
body, and the internal visous humour.
** Eye fixation
+ Methyl-celluose + buffer -> this can be used to fix (toothpaste
  viscosity?) eye while extending safety time before it dries out.
+ Metal bar can be fixed using super glue
+ Super glue fixation is perhaps possible
** Eye models
+ Nothing special here: just nylon string an a ball-bearing
** User Needs -> Relative importance of speed
Nickerson suggests that if we prevent the eye from drying, the total
scan time can expand to ~1hr or more. Effectively:

/DIGITIZATION ACCURACY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN SPEED/

Such a good tradeoff.
