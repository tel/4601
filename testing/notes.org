Notes on the Testing and Verification Protocol
* TESTS
** Ginger 
   physical structure of the harness (it must support the eye, keep it
   safe, rotate cleanly, fit into frame, etc etc)

*** Tweezer support and eyeballs
    + Importance :: (vital for operation ~ interesting to know): Tests
                    whether the optic nerve is held tightly enough by
                    the tweezers to prevent unnecessary eyeball
                    movement/rotation
    + Purpose and background :: The reverse action tweezers have been
         modified to fit into the physical top cap of the piece. This
         test tests whether the cap has been made properly, that is,
         whether the tweezers are still functional within the cap (do
         they hold the eye tightly enough - but not too tight that the
         optic nerve breaks when motor is spun)
    + Functionality :: effect of cap on tweezers...does the cap actually
                       work???
**** Protocol Details
      1. spin the motor - incrementally increase speed
      2. scan eyeball at same time
      3. note any distorted images or extreme movement of eyeball
         (like is the eye hitting the side of the tube)
      4. spin the motor - incrementally increase speed
      5. find speed at which bottom cap disconnects from motor    
**** Results
     + Test Metrics :: the range of #2 above
     + Possible Results :: Possible test results: successful test -
          stays on, failed test - begins to come loose, miserably
          failed - flies across the room and kills somebody or
          shatters into the wall epic fail an epic failure would be if
          the cap disconnects at a speed which we expect to use in the
          actual device (a low speed) Notes: sorry this test is made
          of fail

*** Tweezers/top cap
    + Importance :: Do the tweezers fit
    + Purpose/background :: There are two components. Is the hole big
         enough on the top cap or is the hole designed properly to
         support tweezers
    + Functionality :: don't think this fits into EDS.
**** Protocol
     1. stick the tweezers in the hole
     2. do they fall through? 
     3. can you open and close the tweezers by a large enough distance
        that they can still grasp the eyeball?
**** Results
     + Test Metrics :: how much can you open and close the tweezers?
                       see #3 on protocol. Is there enough leeway (not
                       sure how much numerically) to grasp eyeball and
                       support eyeball when tweezer is inserted into
                       the top cap?

     + Possible test results :: 
          1. FAILURE :: they don't fit - they fall through the hole or
             cannot be opened
          2. SUCCESS :: the tweezers are still functional inside the hole
          3. MODERATE :: tweezers can open and close but not enough to
                         grasp eyeball

*** Tube/caps/silicon
    + Importance :: do the caps and silicon seal the tube
    + Purpose/background :: are the caps going to fall off with high
         velocity motor spin?
    + Functionality :: same as purpose?
**** Protocol
     1. spin motor and incrementally increase speed
     2. do caps fall off? (does Si seal the caps to the tube as it
        should?)
**** Results
     + Test Metrics :: not sure of any numbers - range of distance
                       that caps detach from the tube
     + Possible test results :: does cap completely detach from tube
          or just a little bit at high-velocity motor speed (or lower
          motor speeds that we use to perate the device) Notes:

*** Name of test: fluid inside tube
    + Importance :: Is fluid transparent enough for scanning to be
                    successful
    + Purpose/background :: eye will be fixed in polymer solution, so
         how much does sol'n affect the scan? can eyeball be detected
         effectively or does solution completely block transmittance
         of light?
    + Functionality :: ???
**** Protocol
     1. fill fluid in tube
     2. scan eyeball
**** Results
     + Test Metrics :: ???
     + Possible test results :: eyeball detected but distorted by the
          solution; eyeball detected and not distorted at all by
          solution; eyeball cannot be detected at all because solution
          is too opaque (also the tube we use may have an effect)

** Shuyen
*** Harness frame strength
    + Importance :: good to know that it’s strong, meeting robustness
                    EDS
    + Purpose :: making sure the frame is strong enough to hold things
                 in place
    + Functionality :: Probably related to robustness – things must
                       survive some amount of force
**** Protocol
     subject individual pieces to different loading
     1. tensile and bending
     2. Take one piece; hold it in place with clamp(s)
     3. Load weight on it: 30g, 50g, 100g, 300g, (1kg?) at different
        position
     4. Change the orientation of the piece and load again
     5. Repeat for different pieces
**** Results
     + Test metrics 
       1. Orientation of piece
       2. Amount of weight loaded, 
       3. Position of loading
       4. Breaking (y/n)
     + Possible results 
       + Good :: no breaking
       + Bad :: anything breaks

*** Harness frame assembly failure
    + Importance :: meeting EDS
    + Purpose :: To verify the specification of ability to sustain
                 3-ft drop impact
    + Functionality :: see above
**** Protocol
     1. Assemble frame structure onto base
     2. Drop the assembly from 3-ft height to concrete floor
     3. Examine frame for any material failure (i.e. fracture,
        breaking) or detachment from base or from each other
     4. Repeat several (5-10?) times and record the number of repeat
        and the result of each repeat
**** Results
     + Test metrics
       1. number of repeat (values are from 1-10)
       2. Fracture (y/n)
       3. Breaking (y/n)
       4. Detachment from base (y/n)
       5. Loose connection between frame pieces (y/n) 
     + Possible test results
       + Good result :: all the y/n question receives an “n” (no
                        fracture, breaking, detachment etc)
       + Bad result :: any fracture, breaking, detachment

*** Harness frame stiffness
    + Importance :: meeting stability EDS
    + Purpose :: make sure the frame can hold things in their relative
                 position without much deviation
    + Functionality :: probably related to stability and accurate
                       measurement – things need to be in the right
                       places and not move too much
**** Protocol
    (see harness frame strength test)
    + Note significant bending (visible to the eye, y/n)
    + Measure deflection distance, also record bending direction
**** Results
     + Test metrics
       (same as frame strength test)
       1. Significant bending (y/n)
       2. Deflection (length unit)
     + Possible results
       + Good :: no significant bending at all
       + Bad :: Significant bending, especially at low weight (low
                force)

*** Thermal expansion test
    + Importance :: good to know? May need to meet EDS
    + Purpose :: to verify that the device will work in the
                 temperature range of 22±5 °C
    + Functionality :: structural integrity at room temperature
**** Protocol
     1. Assemble the device at 17 °C
     2. Heat the device up to 27 °C (use a convection incubator or
        something)
     3. Examine device for fracture  
     4. Assemble the device at 27°C
     5. Cool it down to 17°C (refrigerator?)
     6. Examine device for loose connection or detachment
**** Results
     + Test Metrics
       1. fracture with increased T (y/n)
       2. Loose connection with decreased T (y/n)
     + Possible results
       + Good :: no fracture or loose parts
       + Bad :: fracture/loose parts, or not able to assemble when
                temperature is higher
