\section{Testing Protocols}
\label{sec:protocols}

Ginger: physical structure of the harness (it must support the eye, keep it safe, rotate cleanly, fit into frame, etc etc)

Name of test: Tweezer support and eyeballs
Importance of test (vital for operation ~ interesting to know): Tests whether the optic nerve is held tightly enough by the tweezers to prevent unnecessary 
eyeball movement/rotation 
Purpose and background: The reverse action tweezers have been modified to fit into the physical top cap of the piece. This test tests whether the cap has been made
properly, that is, whether the tweezers are still functional within the cap (do they hold the eye tightly enough - but not too tight that the optic nerve breaks when
motor is spun)
Functionality this ties in to (maybe even tie it to an EDS if that's pertinent): don't think this fits with any EDS. Functionality: effect of cap on tweezers...does the
cap actually work???
How to test (measurement, outline of a protocol)
1. spin the motor - incrementally increase speed
2. scan eyeball at same time
3. note any distorted images or extreme movement of eyeball (like is the eye hitting the side of the tube)
The set of test metrics (possibly just one, I suppose): speed at which tweezers drop the eyeball
Possible test results (what does a successful test look like, what does a failed test look like, miserably failed test?): miserable failure - eyeball breaks off from optic nerve; 
eyeball gets dropped
(with this one, quantify: exactly how bad might we expect a failure to be? how separable are the test metrics in a good and a failed device?)
ummm...it qualifies as failure if the eyeball breaks off from nerve when the motor is spinning at a speed range that we expect to use for the actual device. If it breaks off at 
an extreme speed not to be used to operate the device, doesn't count as failure. 
Exactly how bad do we expect a failure to be...I'm not sure...

Any other notes that would help me write the details: ? 


Name of test: Bottom cap/motor
Importance: Does the bottom cap connect and fit into the motor and not fall off the motor when the motor spins really fast - so basically is the bottom cap held tightly enough
by the motor
Purpose/background: This is a physical check to make sure that the motor and the cap are connecting properly and that the cap is rotating at same speed as motor
Functionality: same as purpose????
Protocol: 
1. spin the motor - incrementally increase speed
2. find speed at which bottom cap disconnects from motor
Test Metrics: the range of #2 above
Possible test results: successful test - stays on, failed test - begins to come loose, miserably failed - flies across the room and kills somebody or shatters into the wall epic fail
an epic failure would be if the cap disconnects at a speed which we expect to use in the actual device (a low speed)
Notes: sorry this test is made of fail 



Name of test: Tweezers/top cap
Importance: Do the tweezers fit
Purpose/background: There are two components. Is the hole big enough on the top cap or is the hole designed properly to support tweezers
Functionality: don't think this fits into EDS. 
Protocol: 
1. stick the tweezers in the hole
2. do they fall through? 
3. can you open and close the tweezers by a large enough distance that they can still grasp the eyeball?
Test Metrics: how much can you open and close the tweezers? see #3 on protocol. Is there enough leeway (not sure how much numerically) to grasp eyeball and support eyeball when
tweezer is inserted into the top cap?
Possible test results: 
FAILURE: they don't fit - they fall through the hole or cannot be opened
SUCCESS: the tweezers are still functional inside the hole
MODERATE: tweezers can open and close but not enough to grasp eyeball
Notes:


Name of test: Tube/caps/silicon
Importance: do the caps and silicon seal the tube
Purpose/background: are the caps going to fall off with high velocity motor spin?
Functionality: same as purpose?
Protocol: 
1. spin motor and incrementally increase speed
2. do caps fall off? (does Si seal the caps to the tube as it should?)
Test Metrics: not sure of any numbers  - range of distance that caps detach from the tube
Possible test results: does cap completely detach from tube or just a little bit at high-velocity motor speed (or lower motor speeds that we use to perate the device)
Notes:


Name of test: fluid inside tube 
Importance: Is fluid transparent enough for scanning to be successful
Purpose/background: eye will be fixed in polymer solution, so how much does sol'n affect the scan? can eyeball be detected effectively or does solution completely block transmittance of light?
Functionality: 
Protocol: 
1. fill fluid in tube
2. scan eyeball
Test Metrics: ???
Possible test results: eyeball detected but distorted by the solution; eyeball detected and not distorted at all by solution; eyeball cannot be detected at all because solution is too opaque (also the tube we use may have an effect)
Notes: 

I'll do the final copy-editing as usual -Ginger
