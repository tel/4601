    \textbf{Budget for Developing the Prototype:}
  Each component of the prototype is listed along with price, function, and supplier. Blank prices indicate that the component is being provided for free. The final price estimate is lower than the actual anticipated cost as the budget doesn't account for contingencies.}

  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../img/usage_flow}
  \figcaption{\textbf{Possible Usage Flowchart:}  
  The device is controlled via the computer interface in order to perform a number of tasks required for repeatable, accurate measurement of an eye. Each task is located at and extended over the suggested period of time required to perform the task. Colors of the task boxes encode the required user interaction. Red tasks require direct user interaction with the physical harness, green tasks only require interaction with the computer, and blue tasks are computational tasks where the user must wait.}
