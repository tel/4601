* Matt's Comments
** Overall
*** DONE Page Formatting
    "Very nice formatting"
*** TODO Proper Executive Summary
    "Work on getting a proper executive summary next time"
*** TODO Gantt Chart and Semester Plans
    "More detailed information about your plan for the semester is also important"
*** TODO Device Functional Overview
    "It was important to clearly explain how your device functions. I
    was lft with many questions. As a first time reader I still do not
    clearly understand your project."
*** DONE Formatting
    "JAMA formatting: references fall outside of punctuation"
** Section Specific
*** TODO Executive Summary
    "The executive summary should be almost a page long. There should
    be an important sentence or two relating to each section in the
    report. You don't have any specfics from the EDS section or
    prototype sections."
    + This might need improvement, but I don't think it's going to
      reach 1 page
*** TODO Project Description
**** DONE 1.1
     CLOSED: [2010-02-02 Tue 15:22]
***** DONE Explanation of Sophisticated Measurements
      _directly caused_ -> "If myopia related directly to
      over-exhaustion of the AP axis, why are the other more
      sophisticated measures necessary?"
****** Commentary
       + Myopia is thought to be a symptom of greater changes to eye
         shape. We noted this in the rest of the sentence, but it
         could perhaps be made more clear.
**** TODO 1.2
***** TODO Functional Description
      - _automated digitizer_ -> "What is this?"
      - "An image of the proposed device would be helpful here so I can
        visualize it."
      - _measurement plane of an attached micrometer_ -> "I'm confused
        as to what your device actally is. I get the opportunty but I
        still don't know what your device is."
****** Commentary
       + Cite the schematic figure, except it's not very clear (needs improvement)
       + Improve and cite schematics
       + Vocabulary term or need to improve description?
**** TODO 1.3
***** TODO Market Analysis
      - _by reference_
      - _expensive_ -> "More expensive than 30-100k. What are the other
        options?"
      - _likely carried out at a similar number of research
        institutions_
      - raising the market value to $30 million or higher_ -> "This
           isn't too definitive"
****** Commentary
       + I don't understand the "expensive" comment? What are the
         other lab grade devices? What are other methods to measure
         eyes?
**** TODO 1.4
***** TODO FDA Indemnity
      - _no direct or indirect interaction with living tissue_ ->
        "You're going to measure eyeballs without touching them?"
****** Commentary
       + Is it our concern for how the dissection procedes? We'll be
         only in contact with excised material. FDA doesn't cover this
         according to their website.
       + Biohazard might be a concern, but that's EPA not FDA.
*** TODO EDS
**** TODO 2.1
     - Capitalize Needs, Desires, Wants
     - "Wow, these are some lofty goals"
**** TODO 2.2
     - "225 degrees C"
**** TODO 2.3
     - _Keyence LS7000 series LED micrometer_ -> "Why this micrometer?"
*** TODO Prototype Discussion
**** TODO 3.1
     - "Where is the micrometer in Figure 3?"
**** TODO 3.2
     - "How do the tweezers lock in place? I could ask 1000 questions
       here. It still isn't clear how your device will function. What
       is your final device?"
     - "How much is this going to cost your user?"
     - "How will you assimilate and process this information? Data
       storate, etc."
**** TODO 3.3
     - "Are you planning on implementing this reconstruction
       algorithm?"
*** TODO Project Plan
    - "More specific information on plans, meetings, deadlines,
      etc. are needed. Your Gantt chart should be much more detailed."
