* Matt's Comments
** Overall
   - "Very nice formatting"
   - "Work on getting a proper executive summary next time"
   - "More detailed information about your plan for the semester is also important"
   - "It was important to clearly explain how your device functions. I
     was lft with many questions. As a first time reader I still do not
     clearly understand your project."
** Section Specific
*** Executive Summary
    - "The executive summary should be almost a page long. There should
      be an important sentence or two relating to each section in the
      report. You don't have any specfics from the EDS section or
      prototype sections."
      + This might need improvement, but I don't think it's going to
        reach 1 page
*** Project Description
**** 1.1
     - "JAMA formatting: references fall outside of punctuation"
     - _directly caused_ -> "If myopia related directly to
          over-exhaustion of the AP axis, why are the other more
          sophisticated measures necessary?"
       - Myopia is thought to be a symptom of greater changes to eye
         shape
**** 1.2
     - _automated digitizer_ -> "What is this?"
       + Vocabulary term or need to improve description?
     - _measurement plane of an attached micrometer_ -> "I'm confused
          as to what your device actally is. I get the opportunty but I
          still don't know what your device is."
       + Improve and cite schematics
     - "An image of the proposed device would be helpful here so I can
       visualize it."
       + Cite the schematic figure, except it's not very clear
**** 1.3
     - _by reference_
     - _expensive_ -> "More expensive than 30-100k. What are the other
       options?"
       + I don't understand this comment? What are the other lab
         grade devices? What are other methods to measure eyes?
     - _likely carried out at a similar number of research
       institutions_
     - raising the market value to $30 million or higher_ -> "This
          isn't too definitive"
**** 1.4
     - _no direct or indirect interaction with living tissue_ ->
       "You're going to measure eyeballs without touching them?"
       + Is it our concern for how the dissection procedes? We'll be
         only in contact with excised material. FDA doesn't cover this
         according to their website.
*** EDS
**** 2.1
     - Capitalize Needs, Desires, Wants
     - "Wow, these are some lofty goals"
**** 2.2
     - "225 degrees C"
**** 2.3
     - _Keyence LS7000 series LED micrometer_ -> "Why this micrometer?"
*** Prototype Discussion
**** 3.1
     - "Where is the micrometer in Figure 3?"
**** 3.2
     - "How do the tweezers lock in place? I could ask 1000 questions
       here. It still isn't clear how your device will function. What
       is your final device?"
     - "How much is this going to cost your user?"
     - "How will you assimilate and process this information? Data
       storate, etc."
**** 3.3
     - "Are you planning on implementing this reconstruction
       algorithm?"
*** Project Plan
    - "More specific information on plans, meetings, deadlines,
      etc. are needed. Your Gantt chart should be much more detailed."
