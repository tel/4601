\section{Regulation Overview}
\label{sec:test-administration}

Medical devices are classified into Class I, II, and III based on the
level of regulatory control required by the FDA. All devices must
comply with the Class I General Controls. These include annual
establishment registration, or registration of owners and operators of
facilities that are involved in the production and distribution of
medical devices, as well as a medical device listing of all products
produced at a certain establishment. Devices must be made in
accordance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs), and
manufacturers must develop a system of quality control that in line
with any FDA quality systems (QS) guidelines applicable to their
device. All manufacturing processes and procedures must be
documented. The labeling on the device, including the claims and
advertising, should be in accordance with FDA regulations; it should
be clear, should not be misleading, and should not omit any required
important warnings. Finally, as required by FDA Medical Device
Reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers must report to the
FDA any complaints of malfunction of medical devices as well as
serious injuries or deaths associated with medical devices.

Class II products are defined as products for which general controls
alone are insufficient to assure safety and effectiveness.” Orthopedic
and craniofacial implants are Class II products, as opposed to manual
wheelchairs and hand-held surgical instruments, which are Class I
products.  In addition to following Class I General Controls, Class II
products are subject to Standards or Guidance Documents such as ASTM
or ISO Standards or OCD and OCER Guidance.

For Class II products, manufacturers or companies must submit a
premarket notification in the form of a 510(k). A 510(k) submission
requires the device name, the establishment registration number, the
device classification, documentation of performance standards, and
proposed labels and advertisements, as described in Class I General
Controls. In addition, a 510(k) submission requires a description of
“predicate devices” – devices already in the market that are similar
to the proposed product – and a statement detailing the similarities
and differences between predicate devices and the proposed
device. 510(k) clearance is based on substantial equivalency, which
means that “the new device is at least as safe and effective as the
predicate.” Predicate devices may be in any of the three device
classes. A product is substantially equivalent if it has the same
intended use and technological characteristics as the predicate
device. If a device has the same intended use as the predicate but
different technological characteristics, it should be proven to be as
safe and effective as the predicate and should not raise any new
safety issues.

Class III products are defined as those which “support or sustain
human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of
human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of
illness or injury.” A Pre-Market Approval (PMA) submission and, in
some cases, an investigational device exemption (IDE) are required for
approval of Class III devices. (An IDE may also be required for some
Class II product clearances). An IDE allows the investigational device
to be used in a clinical study, approved both by the FDA and an
Institutional Review Board, to collect safety and effectiveness data
required for a PMA.  In contrast to Class II devices, Class III
devices must receive FDA approval instead of clearance for their use,
components, and manufacturing methods. Class III devices are
significantly different from devices already existent on the market
and present new safety concerns that have not been tested. PMAs must
not only comply with Class I General Controls, but must also
demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device and include
both good science and scientific writing.
	 

\section{Device Classification}
\label{sec:protocols}

Searches in the \textit{FDA Product Classification Database} using the
keywords ``tomography,'' ``ophthalmic,'' and ``micrometer'' were
performed. A few entrys were returned which related to our device:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Optical coherence tomography: General \& Plastic Surgery panel,
  regulation number 886.1570, product code OBO; describes an
  ophthalmoscope as an "Diagnostic device to aid in the detection and
  management of various ocular diseases" capable of "viewing, imaging,
  measurement, and analysis of ocular structures."
\item System, x-ray, tomography, computed: Radiology panel, regulation
  number 892.1750, product code JAK; describes a diagnostic x-ray
  system which relies upon similar technical principles as our
  device. The similarity lies in the method by which measurement
  slices are taken, and the manner in which measurement slices are
  combined to create a reconstruction.
\item Micrometers, Microscope: Pathology panel, regulation number
  864.3600, product code KEH; describes a microscopes and accessories
  as optical instruments used to enlarge images of specimens,
  preparations, and cultures for medical purposes.
\end{enumerate}

While the devices listed above share some common elements with our
device, none of the devices fully capture the intended use and
functionality of our device. One key difference between our device and
those listed above is that our device is not intended for any
diagnotic or clinical applications, but is instead targeted at
research applications. In this regard, our device is most likely not
regulated by the FDA as medical device. According to the FD\&C Act
21USC321, a "device" is "an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine,
contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related
article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is:

\begin{itemize}
\item recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United
  States Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them,
\item intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other
  conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of
  disease, in man or other animals, or
\item intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of
  man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary
  intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of
  man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being
  metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes."
\end{itemize}

Our device clearly does not fall within any of the elements of the
above definition. It is not listed in the National Formulary, US
Pharmacopeia, nor any supplements to them. Furthermore, our device is
not intended for the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in
the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or
other animals. It is solely intended for the measurement of eyeballs
dissected out of mice in research settings. Lastly, our device is not
inteneded for and does not affect the structure or functionality of
any man or animal. 

To conclude, an item by item search in Title 21 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR), part 886 (ophthalmic panel), part 864 (pathology
panel), and part 892 (radiological panel) confirms that our device is
not substantially equivalent to any of the existing devices. While our
device has similar technological and/or functional characteristics, it
differs significantly, as described above. However, considering the
presence of electronic and visible radiation emitting components in
our device, regulations in the FD\&C Act sections 531-542 Electronic
Product Radiation Control provisions are still applicable to our
device.

\subsection{Executive Summary}
\subsection{Device Description}

The described device (eyeScan Mezzo) is a bench-sized digitizer able to accurately measure the three-dimensional surface structure of small organic forms. Specifically designed to measure the convex shape of dissected rat eyes down to \SI{2}{\micro m} resolution its likely usage would involve research aims with respect to eye shape, morphology, or development especially using genetically modified mouse models.

In order to achieve these requirements the device must utilize an LED micrometer, two motor/encoder acutator systems, and a system controller. The device must be able to accurately position the micrometer and the loaded object to the \SI{2}{\micro m} level.

Additionally, the device uses a sophisticated loading harness to hold and rotate the object without needing to account for object deformation under stress. This harness involves a number of opticaly clear pieces and a methyl cellulose support polymer.
