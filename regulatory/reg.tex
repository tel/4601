\section{Regulation Overview}
\label{sec:test-administration}

Medical devices are classified into Class I, II, and III based on the level of regulatory control required by the FDA. All devices must comply with the Class I General Controls. These include annual establishment registration, or registration of owners and operators of facilities that are involved in the production and distribution of medical devices, as well as a medical device listing of all products produced at a certain establishment. Devices must be made in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs), and manufacturers must develop a system of quality control that in line with any FDA quality systems (QS) guidelines applicable to their device. All manufacturing processes and procedures must be documented. The labeling on the device, including the claims and advertising, should be in accordance with FDA regulations; it should not be clear, should not be misleading, and should not omit any required important warnings. Finally, as required by FDA Medical Device Reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers must report to the FDA any complaints of malfunction of medical devices as well as serious injuries or deaths associated with medical devices. 

Class II products are defined as products for which general controls alone are
insufficient to assure safety and effectiveness.” In addition to following Class I General Controls, Class II products are subject to Standards or Guidance Documents such as… For Class II products, manufacturers or companies must submit a premarket notification in the form of a 510(k). A 510(k) submission requires the device name, the establishment registration number, the device classification, documentation of performance standards, and proposed labels and advertisements, as described in Class I General Controls. In addition, a 510(k) submission requires a description of “predicate devices” – devices already in the market that are similar to the proposed product – and a statement detailing the similarities and differences between predicate devices and the proposed device. 510(k) clearance is based on substantial equivalency, which means that “the new device is at least as safe and effective as the predicate.” Predicate devices may be in any of the three device classes. A product is substantially equivalent if it has the same intended use  and technological characteristics as the predicate device. If a device has the same intended use as the predicate but different technological characteristics, it should be proven to be as safe and effective as the predicate and should not raise any new safety issues.

e. If not regulated, state compelling argument
f. What other regulations may apply?

A search in the PRODUCT CODE CLASSIFICATION DATABASE using the
keywords: "tomography" and "ophthalmic", is done. There are few entrys
that partially describes our device. Optical coherence tomography,
product code OBO, regulation number 886.1570, describes an
ophthalmoscope as an "Diagnostic device to aid in the detection and
management of various ocular diseases" capable of "viewing, imaging,
measurement, and analysis of ocular structures."  Computed tomography
x-ray system, product code JAK, regulation number 892.1750, describes
a diagnostic x-ray system of similar technicality to our
device. Either of the definition does not fully describe our device
and the major difference lies in that our device is not intended for
any diagnotics purposes.

Even thought there are existing classified devices that partially
describe our device, our device is most likely not regulated by the
FDA as medical device. According to the FD\&C Act, a "device" is "an
instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in
vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any
component, part, or accessory, which is:

\begin{enumerate}
\item recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United
  States Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them,
\item intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other
  conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of
  disease, in man or other animals, or
\item intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of
  man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary
  intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of
  man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being
  metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes."
  (Cite FD\&C Act 21USC321)
\end{enumerate}

Our device clearly does not fit the second and third definition. It is
not inteneded for any use in or affect the structure or functionality
of any part of a living organism. An item by item search in Title 21
of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 886,ophthalmic panel
and 892 radiological panel, confirms that there our device is not
substantially equivalent to any of the existing devices. Our device
has similar technological characteristic to but does not have the same
intended use as the two entried mentioned above.

However, considering the presence of electronic and visible radiation
emitting component in our device, regulations in the FD\&C Act
sections 531-542 Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions is
still applicable to our device.
