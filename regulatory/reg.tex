A search in the PRODUCT CODE CLASSIFICATION DATABASE using the
keywords: "tomography" and "ophthalmic", is done. There are few entrys
that partially describes our device. Optical coherence tomography,
product code OBO, regulation number 886.1570, describes an
ophthalmoscope as an "Diagnostic device to aid in the detection and
management of various ocular diseases" capable of "viewing, imaging,
measurement, and analysis of ocular structures."  Computed tomography
x-ray system, product code JAK, regulation number 892.1750, describes
a diagnostic x-ray system of similar technicality to our
device. Either of the definition does not fully describe our device
and the major difference lies in that our device is not intended for
any diagnotics purposes.

Even thought there are existing classified devices that partially
describe our device, our device is most likely not regulated by the
FDA as medical device. According to the FD\&C Act, a "device" is "an
instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in
vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any
component, part, or accessory, which is:(1) recognized in the official
National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopeia, or any
supplement to them,

(2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions,
or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in
man or other animals, or

(3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of
man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended
purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other
animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the
achievement of its primary intended purposes." (Cite FD\&C Act
21USC321)

Our device clearly does not fit the second and third definition. It is
not inteneded for any use in or affect the structure or functionality
of any part of a living organism. An item by item search in Title 21
of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 886,ophthalmic panel
and 892 radiological panel, confirms that there our device is not
substantially equivalent to any of the existing devices. Our device
has similar technological characteristic to but does not have the same
intended use as the two entried mentioned above.

However, considering the presence of electronic and visible radiation
emitting component in our device, regulations in the FD\&C Act
sections 531-542 Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions is
still applicable to our device.
