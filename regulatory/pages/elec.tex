\subsection{Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety}

Our device does contain a number of sensitive electronic
devices. Electrical failure of the device cannot result in safety
hazards as under electrical interference the device will simply fail
to deliver results. Additionally, the components of the device are
hardened to electrical shock and resonance. Full testing of the
device's EMC characteristics will be performed according to EC
60601-1-2 Part I.

There is no patient contact with electrical components of the device
as the device is intended to be used exclusively with dissected
eyeballs in research settings.
