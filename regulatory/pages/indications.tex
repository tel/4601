\noindent 510(k) Number (if known): N/A \\
Device Name: \textbf{eyeScan Mezzo} \\
Indications for Use: \\

The \textbf{eyeScan Mezzo} is intended to accurately capture and
reconstruct the three dimensional surface of dissected eyeballs. As
the device is designed for measuring eyeballs and is incapable of
detecting concavities, objects to be measured must ideally be
approximately spherical and should not contain concavities of
interest. Additionally, the device is designed to handle eyeballs by
the optic nerve, meaning that the dissection should not excise the
eyeball from the optic nerve.
