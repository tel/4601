\noindent 510(k) Number (if known): N/A \\
Device Name: \textbf{eyeScan Mezzo} \\
Indications for Use: \\

The \textbf{eyeScan Mezzo} is intended to accurately capture and
reconstruct the three dimensional surface of dissected eyeballs. The
device is designed for measuring eyeballs and is incapable of
detecting concavities, meaning objects to be measured must ideally be
approximately spherical and void of concavities of interest. The
device is designed to handle eyeballs by the optic nerve, meaning the
dissection should be performed so as to preserve the joint between the
and the optic nerve.

The solution that the object to be measured has to be set in has been
designed specifically for use with eyeballs. Other tissue material may
not be of an equivalent tonicity, which may lead to error in
measurment.
