\subsection{Biocompatibility}

This device contains no components which come into direct or indirect
contact with patients. The device is intended for use in research
settings, not clinical settings.

Furthermore, we claim substantial equivalence with microscopes and
accessories (regulation number: 864.3600, product code:
KEH). Microscopes and accessories are identified as optical
instruments used to enlarge images of specimens, preperations, and
cultures for medical purposes. Our device thus makes use of identical
materials used in devices claimed to be substantially equivalent, as
it is intended for use with dissected eyeballs.
