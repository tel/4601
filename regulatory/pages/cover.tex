We seek FDA clearance to market our device, \textbf{eyeScan Mezzo}, a
Class II medical device used for medical scanning of three-dimensional
exterior eye shape. To our knowledge FDA has not classified this
device and, thus, no product code has been assigned or requested for
this device in the Classification Database. The most likely panel for
consideration would be Pathology as suggested by the substantially
equivalent devices. This finished component is a novel device not
previously marketed with FDA clearance in the USA. We solely require
510(k) clearance because due to substantially equivalence with
existant micrometers (regulation no. \textbf{864.3600}, product code
\textbf{KEH}). Manufacturing registration is currently unspecified. No
applicable mandatory performance standards or special controls exist
for this device.
