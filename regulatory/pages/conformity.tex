The device relies on a number of recognized standards. The device
contains electrical components, and is subject to testing under IEC
60601-1-2 Part I. Furthermore, the device contains a laser component,
which under 21 CFR 1000 dictates that the device falls under RCHSA
controls. RCHSA controls indicate that the manufacture of the laser
component of this device is subject to standards 1002.10, 1002.13, and
1002.30, which specifiy necessary reporting on the manufacturing of
the laser component. 

In addition to the above recognized standards, we have developed an
independent set of testing protocols, and have defined specific
acceptance criteria based on the design requirements and intended use
of the device.

Device testing will be conducted and will meet specified acceptance
criteria on all tests, both independently developed and externally
recognized, before the device is marketed.
